# React Component Hierarchy Viewer

This script uses a fork of [pretty-tree](https://github.com/jeffymahoney/pretty-tree) to build and display a visual representation of your React component hierarchy in the console. (The fork simply allows for colors of tree nodes to be depth-based)

## Usage

rch is created with the intent of being installed globally, to make it easy to use anywhere on your system. You can do this with

    $ npm install -g react-component-hierarchy

Once it is installed, you can run it by passing in the path to the source of the root component to begin with and rch will look for and map all of your root component's child components:

```
$ rch
Usage: rch [opts] <path/to/rootComponent>

React component hierarchy viewer.

Options:
  -V, --version             Output the version number
  -a, --aliasing  <config>  Path to Webpack config for getting module alias definitions
  -c, --hide-containers     Hide redux container components
  -d, --scan-depth <depth>  Limit the depth of the component hierarchy that is displayed
  -j, --json                Output graph to JSON file instead of printing it on screen
  -m, --module-dir <dir>    Path to additional modules not included in node_modules e.g. src
  -t, --hide-third-party    Hide third party components
  -h, --help                Output usage information
```

## Requirements

rch has the following requirements to understand your code:

- Component source files may use either a default export or named exports
- Components may be defined in any way (es6 `React.Component` class, functional stateless, or react.createClass)
- Must use raw non-transpiled JS.
- Must use JSX
- Must use ES6 import/export
- Must use relative paths in imports, aliasing with Webpack is for now not permissible
- If you are using React Redux, your component must be wrapped and exported with React Redux's [connect](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api.md#connectmapstatetoprops-mapdispatchtoprops-mergeprops-options) function, e.g:

```js
import { connect } from 'react-redux';

const SomeComponent = ({ title }) => <div>{title}</div>;

export default connect(
  mapStateToProps,
  mapDispatchToProps
)(SomeComponentContainer);
```

Or you can use a separate file for your container component which is formatted approximately like this:

```js
import { connect } from 'react-redux';

import SomeComponent from '../components/SomeComponent';

const SomeComponentContainer = connect(
  mapStateToProps,
  mapDispatchToProps
)(SomeComponent);

export default SomeComponentContainer;
```

(If your container components merely render their children with JSX, that works too.)

# Roadmap

Here follows the features we at Evetro intend to implement on this fork of RCH:
 * Support for outputting the generated component tree to JSON format
 * Support for Webpack aliasing (we REALLY need this for visualizing our React projects)
 * JSdoc in source code
